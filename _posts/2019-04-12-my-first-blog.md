## Just have a try

This is my first blog. 
Studying from other's blog on the internet has been my usual way to learn CS since I was in unversity.
No matter whether it is a good way to learn, I love it. Thanks to those blogers, there are so manyã€€problems I sloved.
So here comes a thought in my head, why not publish my own blog to share my experience and methods to handle problems.

If you dont't have your own blog you can clone this repository and put your articles in a `_posts` folder.
If you already have your own blog then I think you can clone this repository and copy-paste content keeping your `_posts` folder.

After you will have to set up your `_config.yml`
